![og__dtukeczp0ygm_overview](https://github.com/kevgeedj/Module-1-Challenge/assets/128102960/b92fcf24-7f49-41be-9b7b-bf5310b78b14)

## Overview and Origin

* The Apple Card is the first credit card offered by Apple. It is designed to work with the iPhone's Wallet app and Apple Pay. 

* It was incorporated on April 9, 2019. It was announced by Apple on March 25, 2019, during an event held at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California.

* Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in collaboration with Apple Inc, launched Apple Card.

* The idea for the Apple Card stemmed from Apple's desire to offer a more streamlined and user-friendly financial service that integrated with their ecosystem of products and services while Goldman Sachs provides the underwriting, customer service, the underlying platform and all matters related to regulatory compliance.

* Like most credit cards, The Apple Card generates revenue through fees and interest charges. Goldman Sachs is the lender.


## Business Activities

* The card offers streamlined integration with Apple's ios and apps to help manage the users spending habits.

* It is primarily targeted towards Apple users who value the convenience, privacy, and design aesthetics associated with Apple products.

* Apple Card's unfair advantage lies in its seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem, user-friendly interface, unique cashback feature, strong privacy and security measures, and the provision of financial health tools. These aspects differentiate it from traditional credit cards and offer an enhanced and holistic financial experience to Apple users.

* Apple doesn't publicly disclose  specific details about its backend technologies but some notable technologies are Apple's secure element chip, which stores sensitive payment information securely and enables secure transactions without exposing the cardholder's personal data to merchants or Apple itself,  along with Apple Pay Integration.


## Landscape

* The Apple Card is primarily categorized under the domain of mobile payments in the fintech industry.
  
* Some of the latest trends in the mobile payment industry have been contactless, p2p, qr payments along with mobile wallets and biometric authentication.

* Other companies in this domain include Paypal, Google pay, and Samsung pay. With other credit companies offering similar services within their app.

## Results

* Since this was the first time Goldman Sachs ventured into consumer banking, it has created culture clashes within the firm along with millions of dollars of losses in software deployment. On a recent call, Goldman’s CFO said he expects the current “drag” from consumer businesses will reverse into profit as the businesses scale in upcoming years. The loss has been $3.03 billion dollars in the last 3 years. While the mobile payment domain's metrics differ from those of credit cards, most of the losses come from credit card metrics. Some of those include credit loss rate, outstanding balances, and net profit margin. Apple Card has its pros and cons, and other competitors do have some comparable features. However, none of the cards in the market offers a package as centralized and tidily bundled as Apple does.



## Recommendations

* Many credit card users look forward to the rewards they can earn and use toward travel and restaurants. Unfortunately, Apple Card offers no such rewards. Several major credit cards offer transfers of points earned to use toward airline, hotel and restaurants. These perks would be greatly beneficial in today's day and age. As the influx of remote work is greatly vast. It will help expand the use of apple pay internationally with businesses looking to expand their payment options.
